# Flack
## Project 2

This project is analoguous with __Slack__, a popular chat message application. 
Users can send messages to other users, they can create channels and also join channels.

Users' username and the timestamp are associated with every message that they send.


To use this website, you must first **login**


### To run:

(In bash)
`export FLASK_APP=application.py`

`export FLASK_ENV=development`

`flask run`

The website will be avaliable on the port 5000

### DEPENDENCIES:
flask-socketio
flask-session
flask

My personal touch is to create light/dark mode from scratch.
